rm -rf build dist desync_search.egg-info
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*

then run:
pip install --upgrade desync_search


this worked the second time: 

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel twine build
rm -rf build dist *.egg-info
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
python -m build
twine check dist/*
twine upload dist/*
